### Alberto Cappuccino - Hot Cup of Creamy Goodness (+Designer & Arteest)
* Designed and created mock ups for game screens
* Created sprite assets used in the game

### Jobobo Copopopo - The Titular Character (+UI)
* All the UI that's in the game!

### Conner Hasbeard - Just a Man with a Plan. And a Beard (+Designer & Sound)
* Created sound assets used in the game
* Created game logo and app icon

### Nick "MF" Conlon - Gameplay Programmer
* In the beginning Nick created the repo and the Unity project. The Unity project was empty, a formless mass cloaked in darkness. And the Spirit of Nick was hovering over its surface. Then Nick said, "Let there be dots," and there were dots. And Nick saw that it was good. Then he separated the dots from the darkness. Nick called the dots "prefabs" and the darkness "scene." That was the first day of Nick's creation.
* On the second day, Nick created the color.
* On the third day, Nick created the dragging, the blending and all the numbers.
* On the fourth day, Nick created the squares, grid and falling.
* On the fifth day, Nick created the matching, animations and other bug fixes.
* On the sixth day, Nick created all the game modes and gameover.
* On the seventh day, Nick rested. By the seventh day Nick had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. And Nick blessed the seventh day and made it awesome, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done. That is, until Joe decided not to do the UI for last Friday and then Nick had to bail his ass out.
