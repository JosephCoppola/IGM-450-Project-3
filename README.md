Swatch is a game where you touch a color and then go dun dun dun over other colors and let go to make other colors. It doesn't make new colors when the colors are the same though, so the numbers on the colors get higher. Actually, that's not entirely true, because the number on the first color gets lower. Sometimes it gets so low it disappears entirely! But that's okay because colors will fall from the sky to take its place. Anyways, when you make those new colors and you get a bunch together you can pop them like da na na na na and you get points and more colors fall from the sky. It's a pretty trippy experience. Sometimes you can only move a few times, sometimes you can only move for a little while. Either way when it's over you can make fun of other people who have less points.

### Nick "MF" Conlon - Gameplay Programmer
* In the beginning Nick created the repo and the Unity project. The Unity project was empty, a formless mass cloaked in darkness. And the Spirit of Nick was hovering over its surface. Then Nick said, "Let there be dots," and there were dots. And Nick saw that it was good. Then he separated the dots from the darkness. Nick called the dots "prefabs" and the darkness "scenes." That was the first day of Nick's creation.
* On the second day, Nick created the color.
* On the third day, Nick created the dragging, the blending and all the numbers.
* On the fourth day, Nick created the squares, grid and falling.
* On the fifth day, Nick created the matching, animations and other bug fixes.
* On the sixth day, Nick created all the game modes and gameover.
* On the seventh day, Nick rested. By the seventh day Nick had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. And Nick blessed the seventh day and made it awesome, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done. That is, until Joe decided not to do the UI for last Friday and then Nick had to bail his ass out.
* Note from Joe, my UI is the best UI. No one makes UI like I do
